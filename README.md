# Shupa Shupa Secondhand Shop

This project is a **fullstack e-commerce** web app built to sell secondhand clothes from my own wardrobe. The project promotes sustainability and aims to reduce fast fashion by giving garments a second life.
Users can browse available items, view product details, and add them to a shopping cart. The admin interface **(hidden from public view)** allows me to upload and manage listings.
